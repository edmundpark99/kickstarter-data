**_A Written Report and Analysis on the Kickstarter Challenge Results_**

**Overview of the Project**

  This project was designed to be a statistical analysis of various fundraising campaigns of various plays that had such campaigns. Namely, the outcomes of the numerous campaigns were assessed relative to the launch dates of said campaigns as well as the goal, or more specifically, the desired amount of money the campaign aimed to raise, of each campaign. First, the data was filtered out so that only theater projects were analyzed and assessed. A pivot table was then created in order to assess how many theater projects successfully achieved their fundraising goal, how many failed to achieve their fundraising goal, and how many were cancelled, and were filtered by their launch date, more specifically, the month they launched in the year. Second, the provided data was filtered out so that plays would be the only samples assessed, and then were further filtered by their desired goal, how many plays ultimately succeeded in raising the desired amount of money they aimed for, how many failed to do so, and how many were cancelled. Both of these assessments were then graphed.
