**_A Written Report and Analysis on the Kickstarter Challenge Results_**

**Overview of the Project**

  This project was designed to be a statistical analysis of various fundraising campaigns of various plays that had such campaigns. Namely, the outcomes of the numerous campaigns were assessed relative to the launch dates of said campaigns as well as the goal, or more specifically, the desired amount of money the campaign aimed to raise, of each campaign. First, the data was filtered out so that only theater projects were analyzed and assessed. A pivot table was then created in order to assess how many theater projects successfully achieved their fundraising goal, how many failed to achieve their fundraising goal, and how many were cancelled, and were filtered by their launch date, more specifically, the month they launched in the year. Second, the provided data was filtered out so that plays would be the only samples assessed, and then were further filtered by their desired goal, how many plays ultimately succeeded in raising the desired amount of money they aimed for, how many failed to do so, and how many were cancelled. Both of these assessments were then graphed.
  
**Analysis of the Project**

*Process of the Analysis*

  First, in order to access the outcomes of theater fundraising projects in relation to their release date. This was done by using the data that was gathered in an Excel spreadsheet. We first singled out what year each project was released in, by using the =YEAR() function in Excel, using a base date to convert from. From there, a pivot table was created using the data, and the table was filtered based on the parent category of the project as well as the year of the project. The pivot table was then assessed with the count of outcomes as the legend, and the date created as the category with which to divide the outcomes further. The results were subsequently made into a pivot table based on the month they were released, and how many theater projects in said month were successful in their fundraising goals, how many failed to reach said goals, and how many projects were canceled.
